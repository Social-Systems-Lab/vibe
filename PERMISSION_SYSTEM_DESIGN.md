# Application Permissions System: Architecture and Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for the application permissions system. The goal is to create a flexible, role-based access control (RBAC) system that governs user actions within the application.

## 2. Data Models

We will introduce two new data models: `Role` and `Permission`.

### 2.1. Role

A `Role` defines a set of permissions that can be assigned to a user.

-   `_id`: `role:<role_name>` (e.g., `role:admin`, `role:editor`)
-   `name`: The name of the role (e.g., "Admin", "Editor")
-   `permissions`: An array of permission keys (e.g., `["posts:create", "posts:edit"]`)

### 2.2. Permission

A `Permission` represents a specific action that a user can perform.

-   `_id`: `permission:<permission_key>` (e.g., `permission:posts:create`)
-   `key`: The permission key (e.g., `posts:create`)
-   `description`: A human-readable description of the permission.

### 2.3. User Model Extension

The `User` model will be extended to include a `roles` array.

-   `roles`: An array of role names (e.g., `["admin"]`)

## 3. API Endpoints

We will create a new set of API endpoints under `/iam` (Identity and Access Management) to manage roles and permissions.

-   `POST /iam/roles`: Create a new role.
-   `GET /iam/roles`: List all roles.
-   `GET /iam/roles/:name`: Get a specific role.
-   `PUT /iam/roles/:name`: Update a role.
-   `DELETE /iam/roles/:name`: Delete a role.
-   `POST /iam/permissions`: Create a new permission.
-   `GET /iam/permissions`: List all permissions.

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Database Schema Changes

-   Create a new CouchDB database named `iam`.
-   Implement the `Role` and `Permission` data models.
-   Update the `User` model in the `users` database to include the `roles` field.

### Step 2: API Implementation

-   Create a new `IamService` in `apps/vibe-cloud-api/src/services/iam.ts`.
-   Implement the `/iam` API endpoints in `apps/vibe-cloud-api/src/index.ts`.
-   Add authentication and authorization middleware to protect the `iam` endpoints.

### Step 3: Frontend Integration

-   Create a new section in the application settings for role and permission management.
-   Implement UI components to create, read, update, and delete roles and permissions.
-   Update the client-side `User` model to include roles and permissions.

## 5. Next Steps

-   Review and approve this architecture plan.
-   Begin implementation of Step 1.
