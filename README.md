# Vibe

Vibe is a **self-sovereign identity (SSI) framework** that gives users full control over their digital identity and data. It provides a **mobile app (vibe-app), an SDK (vibe-sdk), and react integration (vibe-react)**. Developers can build applications that interact with Vibe, enabling **seamless authentication and data sharing** without centralized storage or third-party intermediaries.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2️⃣ Build Libraries (First Time Only)

```bash
npm run build
```

This builds the core libraries (vibe-sdk and vibe-react) needed by the web applications.

### 3️⃣ Start Development

#### 🟢 Start the Mobile App

Ensure an emulator or device is set up, then run:

```bash
npm run app
```

#### 🌐 Start the Web Applications

The repository includes a streamlined development workflow:

```bash
# Start all web apps with auto-rebuilding of dependencies
npm run dev

# Start a specific app (e.g., contacts)
npm run dev contacts

# Start multiple apps simultaneously (e.g., web and contacts)
npm run dev web contacts

# See all available options
npm run dev --help
```

This command automatically watches for changes in vibe-sdk and vibe-react while running your selected applications.
