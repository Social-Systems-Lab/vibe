# Vibe

Vibe is more than just an appâ€”it's a movement towards true digital freedom. We're building a future where users own their data, control their digital identity, and move seamlessly between apps and services without barriers.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main subprojects:

### `vibe-app`

Mobile application for managing self-sovereign identities. Secure storage of private keys, credentials, and personal data. Built with **Expo/React Native**.

### `vibe-web`

### `vibe-sdk`
