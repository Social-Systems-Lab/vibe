# Vibe React Library

The Vibe React library provides a set of React components and hooks for integrating with the Vibe platform. It is built on top of the `vibe-sdk` and simplifies the process of building Vibe-enabled user interfaces.

## Core Features

-   **Provider Component:** The `VibeProvider` component makes it easy to configure and initialize the `vibe-sdk` within a React application.
-   **Authentication Components:** The library includes pre-built components like `AuthWidget`, `OneTapChip`, and `ProfileMenu` for handling common authentication UI patterns.
-   **`useVibe` Hook:** This hook provides convenient access to the user's authentication state, their data, and the core functionality of the `vibe-sdk`.

## How it Fits into the Vibe Ecosystem

The `vibe-react` library is the recommended way to build Vibe-enabled applications with React. It abstracts away the complexities of the `vibe-sdk` and provides a simple, declarative API that is well-suited for modern React development.
