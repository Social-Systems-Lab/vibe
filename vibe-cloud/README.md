# Vibe Cloud

Vibe Cloud is the foundational personal server node for the Vibe ecosystem. The primary goal of Vibe Cloud is to provide users with a secure, persistent, and self-sovereign digital hub for their identity, data (structured documents and binary blobs), and application interactions. It serves as the user-controlled backend, enabling data synchronization, backup, and a secure API for Vibe-compatible applications.
