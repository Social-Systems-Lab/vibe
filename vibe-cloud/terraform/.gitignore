# Override files
#
# These files provide a way to override entries in your Terraform
# configuration with local values. They are often used to inject credentials
# or other sensitive data, so they should not be committed.
#
# Ignore all .tfvars files, which are often used for sensitive variables.
# If you have specific .tfvars files that ARE NOT sensitive and you WANT to commit,
# you can un-ignore them with ! (e.g., !variables.tfvars)
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json

# Ignore override files from Terraform Cloud unless explicitly unignored
# !override.tf
# !override.tf.json
# !override.tfvars
# !override.tfvars.json

# Include an example for how to unignore a specific .tfvars file if needed
# (though for now, ignoring all is safer)
# !example.tfvars
