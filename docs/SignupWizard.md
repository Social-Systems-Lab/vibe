# Co-Branded Sign‑Up Wizard Design for Vibe and Third-Party Apps

## Goals of the Co‑Branded Sign‑Up Landing Page

The sign-up “landing” page needs to **seamlessly merge the third-party app’s branding with the Vibe platform’s branding**. This page is the user’s first impression of both the app and Vibe during onboarding, so it must:

-   **Clearly communicate what the app is and its value proposition**, so users know why they should sign up.
-   **Introduce the Vibe platform and its benefits** without overshadowing the app’s appeal. The user should understand that by signing up, they get access to the app _and_ become part of the Vibe ecosystem (one account for all Vibe apps, additional platform features, community benefits, etc.).
-   **Build trust through co-branding** – leveraging the credibility of both brands. Research shows that co-branding can increase user trust by combining the reputations of two brands. In our case, seeing both the app and Vibe logos/messages together should reassure users that this is a legitimate, supported integration.
-   **Entice the user to complete registration** by highlighting benefits. The landing page isn’t just a form – it’s essentially a mini-marketing page. It should briefly answer “What’s in it for me?” to motivate sign-ups. (For example, a best practice is to emphasize **benefits of signing up** – what the user will gain – rather than just listing features.)
-   **Avoid confusion** about the relationship between the app and Vibe. It should be explicit that _one_ sign-up creates an account that works for both the specific app and the Vibe platform. Phrases like “Sign up for **AppName** (on the Vibe platform)” or “Join **AppName** – powered by Vibe” can make this clear. Users should not feel like they are signing up twice; it’s a unified process with dual benefits.

Given these goals, the design and content of the landing page must strike a careful balance – **showcasing the app’s unique identity and value, while also introducing Vibe’s platform advantages**. Below, we break down layout considerations and content strategies to achieve this, as well as technical approaches for implementing a co-branded page.

## Layout: Two-Column Design (Desktop) vs. One-Column (Mobile)

On desktop, a **two-column layout** is recommended. This has become a popular pattern for sign-up pages on many platforms, as it allows one side to display marketing or informational content and the other side to contain the sign-up form. For example, services like Facebook, Twitter (X), and Instagram use a two-column sign-up screen: one column focused on visuals and messaging, and the other on the form inputs. This layout helps “unify the sign up form with the overall design and message of the brand” as one commenter noted. It also ensures the page isn’t too bare or utilitarian – the extra content can **provide context, inspiration, or social proof**, making the sign-up experience more engaging.

&#x20;_Example – Instagram’s sign-up page uses a two-column design. The left side features a phone with a carousel of app images to entice users, while the right side contains the sign-up form. This illustrates how imagery and marketing content can accompany a registration form._

For our co-branded scenario, the two-column layout works as follows:

-   **Right Column (Primary)**: The right side will hold the sign-up form or wizard steps (inputs, buttons, etc.). This is the functional part where the user enters their details. It should remain clean and focused. (Many successful sign-up pages keep forms straightforward – e.g., Atlassian’s sign-up has a single email field upfront to minimize friction.) The form area might include a heading like “Create your account” or “Join **AppName**”, and perhaps both the app’s logo and Vibe’s logo in a header for co-branding. The form should always be easily visible and not overshadowed by the left content.

-   **Left Column (Secondary/Informational)**: The left side will display combined branding and marketing content for the app and Vibe. This is essentially the “pitch” area. It can include things like: a catchy headline or tagline, a brief description or bullet points, imagery or illustration, possibly testimonials or stats. The content here is **read-only** (no inputs), meant to inform and persuade. It should answer _why_ to sign up: e.g. “Unlock **AppName**’s features for \[app benefit]. Plus, join the Vibe platform for \[platform benefit].” Including both brands’ selling points in harmony is key. We’ll discuss specific content ideas in the next section.

The two-column approach has a few advantages in this context. It allows us to **simultaneously convey two messages** – one from the app, one from Vibe – side by side. In web design terms, this is akin to a split-screen hero section, which is known to make a strong first impression by showing dual content. In fact, using a split layout is “an excellent way to convey two messages simultaneously” in a single view. Here, those two messages are the app’s value proposition and the platform’s benefits. By seeing them together, the user immediately understands both aspects of the offering.

However, we must ensure the layout is **responsive** and works well on mobile devices. On small screens, two columns typically collapse into a single column (vertical stack). The priority should be given to the form on mobile, since the user’s primary goal is to sign up, and screen space is limited. In practice, this means on mobile devices we would likely show the form **above** or before the marketing content. Several designers have debated this and generally agree: _“Primary purpose of that section is login, so ideally it should be shown first \[on mobile]. If the copy isn’t important enough to be above the login on mobile, remove it.”_. In other words, the user shouldn’t have to scroll past a marketing block to find the sign-up fields on a phone.

So our mobile approach could be: a simplified one-column layout with the sign-up form at top, and the combined app/Vibe info either condensed below it or possibly hidden behind an expandable section if space is a concern. We might include a small tagline or logo cluster at the top as an immediate cue (so users know they’re signing up for _AppName via Vibe_), but keep any longer explanatory text or images below the form or omitted for mobile. It’s acceptable if the marketing content is less prominent on mobile – many sites sacrifice those extras on small screens for the sake of usability. The key is that the user can still complete registration easily, and at least get a hint that this is a co-branded experience (via logos or a brief phrase). We can also consider using a shorter version of the imagery (or a single static image) on mobile to save space, rather than a carousel or large graphic.

In summary, **desktop gets the rich two-column experience** (form + a visually engaging info panel), while **mobile gets a streamlined one-column flow** (form first, with minimal branding info). This ensures we maintain conversions on all devices: the extra content can nudge desktop users to sign up (and has tested positively in A/B tests), but it won’t impede mobile users who have less screen to work with.

## Communicating Both Brands: Content and Visual Strategies

The core challenge is presenting both the third-party app and Vibe platform **side by side in the narrative** of the sign-up. We want users to learn about _both_ as they go through the wizard. Here are strategies to achieve this:

-   **Combined or “Split” Hero Messaging:** One approach is to design a single hero section that merges the two brands’ imagery or messages. For example, using a **split-image or diagonally blended graphic** that literally merges visuals from the app and Vibe can be very impactful. This could mean one half of the left panel background shows an image representing the app (e.g. a screenshot or illustration of the app’s functionality) and the other half shows something representing Vibe (maybe community, connectivity, or the platform’s logo/mascot). A subtle diagonal or fade transition between them can create a modern look that implies “these two things come together here.” This concept aligns with creative split-screen design techniques where two themes are juxtaposed to tell a combined story. It immediately gives the impression of a partnership. Along with the visuals, the text headline could also be combined, e.g., **“Welcome to _AppName_ on Vibe”** as a single title. Supporting text might briefly say “By joining _AppName_, you become part of the Vibe platform – unlocking features of _AppName_ plus platform-wide benefits.” The idea is that in one glance, the user sees a **fusion of brands**: the app’s name/logo and Vibe’s name/logo presented together. (For instance, we might show both logos at top, perhaps _AppName_ logo “× Vibe” or “+ Vibe” to denote a collaboration.) This one-screen approach ensures the user doesn’t miss either message – it’s all there up front.

-   **Carousel or Changing Imagery:** Another approach is to use multiple slides or images that rotate or progress, so that we can _separate_ the app-focused content and the platform-focused content into different frames. Many sign-up pages use a carousel on the side to showcase product highlights (a great example is Instagram’s sign-up page, which cycles through a series of images/features on the left【9†】). We could apply a similar idea: the left panel could auto-rotate or allow tabbing between (for example) **“About _AppName_”** and **“About Vibe”**. On the _AppName_ slide: show the app’s selling points (maybe an illustration of the app in action, with a caption like “Do X and Y with _AppName_! \[App’s tagline].”). On the Vibe slide: show platform benefits (maybe an illustration of the Vibe ecosystem or users connected, with text like “One account – many apps. Discover more experiences on Vibe while using _AppName_.”). This way the user can grasp each aspect one at a time. We could even include a third slide if needed – e.g. testimonials or social proof (“Over 1,000 people use _AppName_ on Vibe” etc.) – although we should avoid an overly long rotation that distracts from signing up. The carousel could either auto-play (with a few seconds delay, as a passive background element) or let the user manually click through tips/features. Auto-play has the benefit of exposing the user to both messages even if they don’t interact – for instance, as they start filling the form, the image might switch from the app image to the Vibe image, subtly informing them of the platform. If using auto-rotation, we’d keep the transitions gentle and slow, so it doesn’t annoy the user’s eye while typing.

-   **Step-by-Step Emphasis Shift:** Since we have a multi-step wizard, we can coordinate the content with each step. Perhaps **Step 1** (the initial landing page of the wizard) focuses on the app, and **Step 2** (or a later step) focuses on Vibe. For example: at Step 1, the left panel could show _AppName_ branding, tagline, and an image or two highlighting what the app does. The user at this stage is primarily interested in the app (that’s likely what brought them here), so we hook them with the app’s value. Once they proceed (say Step 1 collects basic info like email/password), then Step 2 could transition the left panel content to Vibe’s branding and message – e.g. “You’re joining the Vibe platform – here’s what that means for you.” This second-step content can highlight things like “Access multiple apps with one account, find communities, manage all your data in one place,” or whatever Vibe’s core benefits are. Since the user has already committed to starting sign-up, this is a good moment to bolster their decision by telling them the _additional_ benefits they’re getting via Vibe (possibly increasing excitement or at least understanding). This sequential reveal ensures the user sees both sets of info at appropriate times, without crowding everything on the very first screen. Technically, this means the left column’s content would dynamically update when the user advances the wizard (the UI can simply swap text/images). This approach takes advantage of the multi-step nature – essentially it’s like a guided tour: first “About the App,” next “About the Platform,” etc. We just need to ensure the transition is smooth and it’s clear that it’s all part of the same sign-up flow (the header or overall page framing would remain consistent to avoid feeling like it jumped to a different page).

-   **Visual Style:** Regardless of static vs. carousel vs. step-change, the visual design should feel cohesive. Using the app’s primary color and imagery alongside Vibe’s branding elements (like using a complementary color or a neutral background for Vibe info) will help merge the styles. We might do things like use the app’s logo and name in big text, with a small “powered by Vibe” beneath it. Or show the app logo and Vibe logo side by side at equal sizes to indicate partnership. The GitHub OAuth example (shown below) is instructive: GitHub’s authorization page shows the third-party app’s logo/name prominently (“MantisHub by mantishub”) in the context of a GitHub page, with GitHub’s logo still on the page and a consistent layout. It’s a **co-branded page** where you clearly see _both_ identities【10†】. We can emulate that concept – e.g., a header bar or footer could always carry “Vibe” branding, while the main panel carries the app branding. The user thus never forgets this is a unified experience.

&#x20;*Example – GitHub’s OAuth authorization page as a model of co-branding. The page uses GitHub’s standard layout (note the GitHub logo and style), while prominently displaying the third-party app’s name and icon (“MantisHub”). This instills trust that the platform (GitHub) is in control, yet informs the user which app is requesting access. Similarly, our sign-up can present *AppName* within a Vibe-branded interface.*

-   **Messaging and Tone:** We should craft the text to smoothly incorporate both brands. For instance, the headline could literally join the names: “Sign Up for _AppName_ on Vibe.” Supporting text might be something like: “Create your **Vibe account** and get started with **AppName**. As a Vibe member, you can enjoy \[app benefit] and \[platform benefit].” It’s important to be concise – the user likely won’t read long paragraphs. Bullet points or short phrases can efficiently communicate key points. For example:

    -   _AppName_ lets you: **\[One major thing the app does]**
    -   On Vibe you can: **\[One key platform perk]**
    -   One account, two benefits: access _AppName_ + Vibe’s community/features.

    This way, in just a few lines, they see a value from the app and a value from Vibe. We should **highlight benefits over features**, as noted earlier, to make it compelling (“Save time by doing X” rather than “X feature included”).

-   **Use of Social Proof or Trust Signals:** If available, we might include a bit of social proof applicable to either the app or Vibe. For example, if the app has notable accolades or number of users, that could be a small caption (“Over 5,000 users have joined” or a quote from a happy user). And for Vibe, maybe a note like “Trusted platform – 20 apps and counting” or a security badge (“Your data is secure with Vibe”). These elements further build credibility. Placing a testimonial or user count on the left panel can _nudge the prospect to finish signup_ by increasing confidence. We must be selective and keep it brief, so it doesn’t overwhelm the design. But one bullet or a sub-text with this info can be beneficial.

In essence, the content strategy is about **storytelling for two**: telling the app’s story and the platform’s story in parallel. Whether through a single combined image or multiple sequential ones, the user should walk away (or rather, proceed to form submission) understanding: _“I am signing up for this cool app, and it’s part of this broader Vibe thing which also seems beneficial.”_ Achieving that understanding will prevent surprise (“What is Vibe? Why did I end up here?”) and instead create a positive impression (“Neat, I get this app’s features plus I join a platform where maybe there are other apps or perks.”).

Finally, whichever approach we choose, we should **user-test the messaging**. For example, A/B test a version where the first screen heavily emphasizes the app vs. one that equally emphasizes both, to see which yields better completion rates. It’s important not to distract from the conversion goal: a balance between marketing and usability is needed. But generally, providing context (about the app and platform) _reduces friction_ because users know what they’re getting into and feel informed. This context-building is exactly the role of our left panel content – to guide the user and answer unspoken questions (“What is Vibe? Why do I need it?”) thereby **increasing confidence** and likelihood to sign up. As one commenter noted about two-column sign-ups: the added context can prevent the form from feeling like it’s “floating in space” with no explanation.

## Structured Template vs. Custom IFrame Approach

Now, turning to _how_ we implement this co-branded page: we have two broad options – a **structured approach** or an **iframe-based approach** (or a hybrid of both).

### Structured Co-Branded Layout (Standard Template)

In the structured approach, we (the Vibe platform) define a common template for the sign-up page and simply populate it with app-specific data (passed via query parameters, which we’ve agreed to do). This means every app’s sign-up landing will follow the same general layout, but with their own content plugged in. For example, the template might expect parameters or a config like: **app name**, **app logo URL**, **app primary color**, **app tagline**, **app description or bullet points**, and perhaps an **optional image or illustration URL**. Using these, the page would dynamically render the left column content for that app alongside the standard Vibe messaging. Vibe’s own logo and text could be baked into the template (e.g., always show “Powered by Vibe” somewhere, always include a blurb about Vibe in a certain spot). The _style_ (fonts, layout structure, button styles) would largely follow Vibe’s design system to keep things consistent and professional across all apps, with a few theming tweaks based on the app’s branding (like using the app’s color for headings or the hero background).

**Pros of the structured approach:**

-   **Consistency and Usability:** Users get a familiar experience no matter which app they’re signing up for. This consistency builds trust (since it looks like the official Vibe process every time) and makes it easy for users to switch apps without relearning the flow. Big identity providers take this approach – for instance, Google’s OAuth sign-in page always looks like Google’s UI and simply inserts the app name (“Choose an account to continue to \[AppName]”) in the text. They do _not_ let each app redesign the Google sign-in page, for security and consistency reasons. We can emulate that philosophy. Another example: Microsoft Azure AD allows company-specific branding (logos, background color) on its login pages, but within a fixed Microsoft template – they explicitly **do not allow external web content** to be injected. This ensures the page can’t be hijacked or made to look phishy. We should similarly keep control over the layout for a polished, safe feel.

-   **Technical Simplicity and Performance:** A template where we plug in data is straightforward to implement. Passing query parameters (like `?app_id=123`) and then server-side (or client-side) looking up the app’s info to render the page is quite manageable. There’s no need to load external pages. Everything can be optimized in one bundle. It will likely load faster and be more mobile-optimized because we control the assets and ensure they’re not overly large or clunky. We can also ensure responsive behavior uniformly. With an iframe, we’d be loading a separate webpage inside, which might not be as optimized for this context.

-   **Maintains Vibe’s Branding Presence:** With our own template, we can guarantee that Vibe’s messaging is always included as desired. An app couldn’t “skip” mentioning Vibe, because our template will have a slot that always says something about the platform. This is important for communicating the platform’s value consistently. It also prevents any scenario where an app might present something misleading or off-brand in the sign-up flow – we retain a level of control to protect both the user experience and the platform’s reputation.

-   **Flexible Enough for Most Apps:** We can design the template to be fairly flexible in terms of content. For example, we could allow the app to choose between a few layout options within the template: maybe **Option A** has a static image + text, **Option B** allows a short looping video or slideshow (if the app provides 2-3 images), etc. All within predefined safe bounds. This structured flexibility is akin to how some SaaS platforms let you “customize” a page by filling in predefined fields (like text and images) but not altering the underlying HTML/CSS. It gives apps some creative freedom (they can supply their own imagery and copy that best represent their product) while ensuring the end result still looks like a cohesive part of the Vibe site.

-   **Analytics and A/B Testing:** With a unified template, Vibe can more easily track usage (drop-off rates at each step, etc.) and run A/B tests across multiple apps. If each app had a totally custom page, it’d be harder to ensure things like the placement of elements is optimal, or to run a platform-wide improvement (say we discover a certain phrasing or layout change improves conversion, we can update the template and benefit all apps). The structured approach lets us continuously improve the sign-up UX in one place.

**What the structured page might look like:**
We envision a two-column design as described. The app would likely provide: a logo, a headline or tagline, a description (perhaps a paragraph or up to 3 bullet points), and optionally a main image or two. For example, an app might provide an image URL of their product screenshot and a tagline “Collaborate with ease on X”. Our template would then display something like: a top-left area with the app’s logo and tagline, below it the bullet list of features/benefits (provided by app) in smaller text, and at the bottom a small section or line about Vibe (“Powered by Vibe Platform – one account for all apps”). Alternatively, we might intermix the content: e.g., the first bullet could be about the app, the second about Vibe, etc., depending on design. We should also ensure the _visual_ branding (colors, etc.) can adjust: perhaps use the app’s theme color for the left panel background or accents, so it feels native to the app’s identity. But overall, the page chrome (fonts, button style) stays Vibe-consistent.

This approach could be quite flexible. If an app has no custom image, we could default to a generic illustration. If an app doesn’t provide some text, we have defaults (like “\[AppName] is powered by Vibe – join a growing community!” etc.). That way, even with minimal input, the page still works. And if an app really wants to “go all out” within this structured format, they can provide a nice high-res image, a punchy tagline, and some great benefit bullets – essentially _akin to a mini-landing-page_, but one that we format for them.

One thing to note: content guidelines. We may need to guide third-party developers on how to provide effective copy for this (maybe even have a review process), since some might not know how to best pitch their product in two sentences. Providing best practices (like _“highlight benefits, keep it short”_) or even offering to auto-generate some text could help maintain quality. Remember, a confusing or lengthy blurb can hurt conversion, so we want to ensure the content fits the template nicely.

### Allowing a Custom IFrame Landing Page (Fully Custom Content)

The other approach is to allow third-party apps to design and host their own “landing page” and then embed it in our wizard via an `<iframe>`. In this scenario, when the user hits the sign-up landing, the left side (or perhaps the entire page for step 1) could effectively display an external webpage that the app created – presumably a page tailored to promoting their app and integrating the “Sign Up” call-to-action with Vibe.

For example, we might allocate the left column as an iframe that loads `https://appname.com/vibe-signup-landing` (just hypothetical). That page could be fully designed by the app’s team to show whatever they want: a fancy animation, detailed info, their own CSS styling, etc. Meanwhile, the right column (the form) would still be under Vibe’s control. We might even allow the iframe page to hide the form and have a “Sign Up” button that, when clicked, triggers our form (via postMessage or some JavaScript bridge) – but this gets complicated. More likely, the iframe content would be purely informational and maybe have a prompt like “Enter your details to join →” which corresponds to filling the form on the right.

**Pros of the custom iframe approach:**

-   **Maximum Flexibility for Apps:** They can express their brand exactly as they want. If they have a very strong brand identity or existing marketing site, they can replicate that inside the iframe. They aren’t limited by the Vibe template’s constraints. This could allow more creative freedom – e.g., use of custom fonts, longer text, interactive elements, even a video demo. Some apps might have very specific onboarding pitches that a generic format can’t accommodate. An iframe means they basically get a blank canvas (within the iframe rectangle) to do as they please. For instance, an app could embed a short promo video about their product in that space, something that might be hard to do in a structured template (though not impossible).

-   **Custom Layouts**: If an app doesn’t like the two-column idea, theoretically they could design their iframe content differently (maybe they want a full background image, or multiple slides with their own style of carousel). As long as it fits/resizes in the iframe, they have control. It’s essentially allowing a **fully custom landing page** for the app, living within the sign-up flow.

-   **Potential for Richer Content**: Some products might benefit from more explanation. For example, a complex app might want to include FAQs, or a longer list of features, or specific imagery. With the structured approach we’d intentionally limit that to keep it concise, but maybe a particular app finds that users convert better if they see more info first. Their custom page could be tuned to their audience. It could even be localized or personalized beyond what our template allows.

Despite these benefits, there are significant **cons and challenges** to consider:

-   **User Experience Integration:** An iframe is essentially a “page within a page.” It may be difficult to make it feel completely seamless. Differences in styling could make the overall screen feel disjointed (e.g., if the iframe has a dark background and our form has a light background, it might clash unless coordinated). We could provide guidelines to apps to try to match certain overall styles, but there’s no guarantee. Also, if the iframe has its own scroll, that can be awkward – e.g., imagine on a shorter laptop screen, the iframe content might scroll separately from the main page if it’s taller than the viewport. This can confuse users (two different scrollbars). We could mitigate by sizing the iframe height to fit its content (via postMessage communication to adjust height), but it’s extra complexity.

-   **Performance:** Loading an external page inside an iframe can slow down the initial load. The user might see an empty left panel for a moment while it fetches the content from the app’s server. If that server is slow or down, it hurts the experience. With a template, everything comes from our server in one go. With an iframe, you depend on a third party’s content delivery. If something fails, the left side might show an error or nothing (we’d need error-handling like a timeout fallback that shows a default message). Also, mobile users on limited bandwidth might struggle if the iframe content is heavy (images/videos).

-   **Security and Trust:** Iframes have a bit of a bad rap for security reasons. They can be used for phishing or loading malicious scripts if not handled carefully. Many modern sites and customers are wary of embedded third-party content. In fact, as one developer recounted: “Our customers and security guys are against iFrames due to security risks of this technology.”. The main concerns include potential for cross-site scripting if the content is not sandboxed, and just general unpredictability. We can sandbox the iframe (disallow scripts or limit capabilities), but if we sandbox too much then the app’s page might not function as intended (e.g., a video or interactive feature might break). Additionally, some browsers or content security policies might block third-party content if not properly configured (the app would need to send appropriate headers to be embeddable, etc.). It introduces a lot of moving parts.

-   **Maintaining Vibe’s Message:** If we give full control to the app’s iframe, they might _choose not to mention Vibe at all_ or bury it. They could create a page that talks only about their app, and then the user might still be confused “Why am I on a Vibe domain to sign up?” if the app doesn’t clarify. We could require that they include certain phrases or an official Vibe footer on their content, but enforcing that is tricky. With a template we can ensure Vibe is appropriately represented. With an iframe, an app might even accidentally (or intentionally) misrepresent things (“Sign up now for _AppName_, it’s totally independent!” which could set wrong expectations). To avoid user confusion, we’d have to trust each partner to adhere to guidelines in their custom content.

-   **Development & Maintenance Effort:** Supporting arbitrary custom pages means each app developer has to build one, and our system has to accommodate them. We’d likely need documentation on how their page should interact with the form (if at all). Possibly, we’d want some messaging API so that, for example, if the user hits “Submit” on our form and an error occurs (like email already in use), the iframe could hide or change if needed. Without coordination, the iframe might keep showing a “Join now!” message even after the user submits. These edge cases make it harder to ensure a smooth flow. It’s doable, but more complex. Also, for any future changes to our flow, we’d need to consider backwards compatibility for any custom pages out there. By contrast, a structured template is fully under our control – if we change something in the layout, it applies to all instantly.

Given these trade-offs, a **hybrid approach** might be prudent: support the structured template by default (which covers the needs of most apps), and allow the iframe option only for those apps that have special requirements and the resources to create a good custom page. In other words, **offer both** but with a preference towards the standard format for simplicity.

### Hybrid Recommendation

We can implement the wizard such that by default, it uses our co-branded template (pulling app data via query parameters as agreed). This ensures a baseline quality and that every app gets a decent landing page with minimal effort. Then, if an app partner specifically wants more control, we could give them an option: e.g., a config flag like `useCustomLanding=true` and a URL to load in an iframe. When that flag is set for the app, our sign-up page would load the iframe instead of the usual left-column content.

To make this successful, we’d need to establish some **guidelines** for custom pages:

-   They should include the app’s pitch _and_ an explanation of Vibe (perhaps we enforce that the text “Vibe” appears, or we overlay “Powered by Vibe” on top of the iframe content in a corner).
-   They should be responsive (the iframe content needs to handle mobile screens or we will default to the standard template on mobile if the custom content isn’t mobile-friendly). We might require them to provide a mobile-optimized version or just ensure their HTML/CSS is fluid.
-   We might restrict the height or behavior to avoid double scrollbars (for example, instruct them: “make your content height 100% and avoid any internal scrolling, so it fits in the container we provide”). If needed, we could communicate the viewport height via postMessage so they can size appropriately.
-   We should strongly encourage security best practices, possibly using the `sandbox` attribute on the iframe (which can disable script access to our `window` and so forth) for safety. If the app needs scripting that communicates with our page, we’d expose a controlled API (postMessage listening for certain allowed commands).

By supporting an iframe option, we acknowledge that some apps’ marketing teams may want a completely tailored experience. But we should monitor usage – if very few need it, it might not justify the complexity. If many ask for it, we can invest in making it smooth.

**Technical flow for query parameters:** Regardless of approach, passing app-specific data via the URL (query params) is straightforward and we’ll do that (e.g., `.../signup?appId=XYZ`). The sign-up page can then fetch additional data from our database about that app (like its name, etc.). For the structured template, it will populate fields with that data. For the iframe approach, it might look up the custom URL to embed from the app’s settings.

One consideration: **Cohesion between app and platform content**. If we allow an iframe that is essentially a full landing page, one might ask: why not just redirect the user to the app’s own site for sign-up? The reason we’re embedding is to keep them in the unified flow (and possibly to let them fill the Vibe form simultaneously). It’s important that, even with an iframe, the user perceives it as one workflow. For instance, maybe the iframe content ends with an obvious arrow or indicator pointing to the form, or the form might highlight once the iframe content finishes its spiel. We don’t want the user to finish reading the iframe and then not realize they need to interact with the right side to actually sign up. So coordination in design is needed (e.g., perhaps the iframe content has a big “Let’s get started!” that visually corresponds to the form fields on the right, or an arrow graphic). In a structured design, we can naturally integrate text and form together (“Sign up below to get started”), which is easier.

**Industry precedent:** Most big platforms lean toward structured pages with limited customization, for the reasons above. For example, OAuth consent screens (Google, Facebook, etc.) only let the third-party supply a logo and app name, nothing more. Enterprise SSO (like Azure AD) allows branding (logos/colors) but not arbitrary HTML. This is largely due to security and consistency. That said, our scenario is slightly different in that it’s a user-facing _joint onboarding_ rather than just a permissions dialog. There might be cases (especially in consumer-facing apps) where a richer presentation is beneficial.

Perhaps a middle ground could be offering **templates** or themes instead of freeform iframes. For instance, we could have a “custom landing mode” where an app can provide a **full-screen illustration or background** that takes over the left side, and maybe more text, but still within our page structure. This would avoid an actual iframe but give a more unique look. It’s worth considering if that could satisfy the desire for customization without the downsides of an iframe.

**Conclusion / Path Forward:** Initially, I would recommend starting with the **structured two-column approach** as the default. It’s simpler to implement and ensures we handle the main challenge (communicating both brands) in a user-friendly way. We can design that page to be flexible enough for most use cases. Simultaneously, we can plan for an **iframe-based override** as an advanced feature. This could be rolled out carefully – perhaps only to select partners or as a beta – to see if it’s truly needed and how well it works. We should also gather feedback from our third-party developers: do they feel a standard format is too limiting? Or are they happy as long as their logo and a bit of text are there? It’s possible that many will prefer to let Vibe handle the heavy lifting of the design (one less thing for them to build).

By supporting both options, we provide versatility: apps that want simplicity just pass a few query parameters and get a nicely formatted sign-up landing page; apps that want full control can embed their own. In all cases, the **user experience should remain smooth**: they see a professional, cohesive page that clearly introduces _AppName_ and Vibe together, whether that content came from our template or an app’s custom page. And during the process, they come to understand the relationship – which is exactly our goal.

## Summary of Key Recommendations

-   **Use a two-column layout on desktop** to present marketing content alongside the sign-up form. This content will merge the app’s branding and Vibe’s branding, delivering two messages at once (the app’s value and Vibe’s value). On mobile, collapse to one column with the form first, and keep additional info minimal so as not to impede the sign-up flow.
-   **Ensure both the third-party app and Vibe are prominently represented.** Show both logos or names (e.g., “_AppName_ on Vibe”), and include text that explains the benefits of each. The user should immediately recognize the app they’re signing up for, and also be introduced to Vibe. Co-branding done right can increase user trust by combining the reputations of both brands.
-   **Leverage the left panel for persuasive content.** This can include an eye-catching image or slideshow of the app (as Instagram does on its sign-up page【9†】), a tagline, and a few bullet points highlighting benefits of joining. Include at least one point about the Vibe platform (e.g. “Access other apps and community on Vibe”). Keep the copy benefit-driven and succinct. Optionally add social proof (user counts, testimonials) to boost credibility, as two-column sign-up pages with such info have shown positive results in A/B tests.
-   **Use a structured template by default** for this landing page. Populate it with app-specific data via query parameters. This guarantees a consistent, high-quality user experience and makes it easy to communicate Vibe’s value uniformly. (It mirrors how platforms like Google handle third-party sign-ins – inserting app info into a standard Google-branded page.) The template can allow some customization (app logo, tagline, image, theme color) but will maintain overall layout and important messaging (including a “Powered by Vibe” note).
-   **Consider a hybrid approach for customization.** If needed, allow advanced partners to supply a custom landing page (embedded via iframe) to use in place of the standard format. However, this should be approached with caution due to UX and security considerations. Many systems avoid third-party iframes for good reason. If we implement it, enforce guidelines (responsive design, inclusion of Vibe messaging, secure content). Potentially sandbox the iframe and provide a communication mechanism if necessary.
-   **Focus on a cohesive narrative through the sign-up steps.** Whether through a single combined page or changing content per step, guide the user from _app introduction_ to _platform introduction_ smoothly. By the end of the sign-up wizard, the user should feel informed about both what the app offers and what the Vibe platform adds. For example, Step 1’s left panel could emphasize the app’s features, Step 2 could emphasize Vibe’s community/features. This leverages the wizard format to avoid overloading one screen.
-   **Maintain clarity and avoid confusion.** Prominently state that creating an account will enable use of the app and the Vibe platform. There should be no ambiguity about what they’re signing up for. For instance, include a brief description like: “You’ll create a Vibe account that lets you access **AppName** and other apps on the platform.” This sets the right expectation and turns what could be seen as a “hurdle” (signing up for an extra platform) into a selling point (added value of Vibe).
-   **Keep mobile users in mind.** On mobile, if the left-panel content is non-essential, it can be moved below the form or omitted. Another idea is to use a simplified version (e.g., just a small header image or a single line about the app and Vibe). Always ensure the form is front and center on small screens to minimize any friction.

By implementing the above, we tackle the main challenge: **merging the third-party app’s landing page vibe with the Vibe platform’s branding and message** in one cohesive sign-up wizard. The user will get a sense of the app’s identity and the platform’s benefits in tandem, increasing their motivation to register and their trust in the process. Our recommendation is to not feel constrained by any single UI idea (like the diagonal image) – instead, iterate through a few design mockups (split-screen, carousel, step-wise content) and even test them with users to see which conveys the combined story best. Given that co-branding in sign-up is somewhat unique, we should be willing to refine the design based on real feedback. Ultimately, the sign-up “landing” should be more than just a form – it should **onboard the user into both a new app and a new platform simultaneously, in a way that feels natural and compelling**.
