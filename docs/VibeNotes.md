# Vibe Notes MVP – Basic Features and UI Design

## Overview of Vibe Notes

Vibe Notes is a simple note-taking web app (Next.js) built on the Vibe Cloud platform. It focuses on personal note-taking with an intuitive interface, while leveraging Vibe Cloud’s unique strengths like user-owned data and cross-app integration. Under the hood, each user’s notes are stored in their personal Vibe database (a per-user CouchDB) and synced in real-time via PouchDB on the client[\[1\]](https://github.com/Social-Systems-Lab/vibe/blob/8e07d15e4c528b89d5792bf7e0d372e29d4a6caf/docs/Vibe.md#L14-L19). This _zero-backend_ approach means the app is purely front-end, relying on Vibe’s API/SDK for authentication, storage, and sync[\[2\]](https://github.com/Social-Systems-Lab/vibe/blob/8e07d15e4c528b89d5792bf7e0d372e29d4a6caf/docs/Vibe.md#L27-L35). By default, all notes are private to the user (enforced by Vibe’s document-level ACLs that only allow the owner’s DID by default[\[3\]](https://github.com/Social-Systems-Lab/vibe/blob/8e07d15e4c528b89d5792bf7e0d372e29d4a6caf/docs/Vibe.md#L15-L19)). Sharing and collaboration features will be considered later, but the MVP assumes notes are personal unless the user explicitly shares them. The design takes inspiration from lightweight note apps like Google Keep (which is intentionally barebones[\[4\]](https://zapier.com/blog/best-note-taking-apps/#:~:text=is%20what%20makes%20Google%20Keep,option%20for%20Google%20power%20users)) and mobile notepad apps like Notein, aiming for a clean, uncluttered experience.

**Key Goals:** Keep the UI minimal and fast, so creating a note is as quick as scribbling on paper. Ensure notes sync securely across devices via the user’s Vibe Cloud (so a note created on desktop is available on mobile instantly) and allow optional rich content (formatting, images) without overwhelming the interface. Advanced Vibe-specific capabilities (consent-based sharing, linking to other app data) will be built in quietly so they can be extended later, but they won’t complicate the initial user experience.

## Core Features and Functionality

-   **Create and Edit Notes:** Users can create a new note with a **Title** and a **Content** field. The content area is the primary focus – as soon as you open or create a note, the cursor is in the content editor ready to type. The editing experience is rich-text but with a _distraction-free_ approach. By default the note looks like plain text on a page; formatting controls are hidden until needed (e.g. appearing in a toolbar when the user highlights text or clicks a format button). This way the interface stays clean and “notebook-like,” as one user put it: _“I think I just don't want any of the customizations. It's a clutter. I would like something comparable to a paper notebook… All I need is to type my notes… It should have an index… Auto save feature. No fonts, but bold and underline would be awesome.”_[\[5\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/apps/comments/1hvb1s3/simple_notepad/#:~:text=I%20think%20I%20just%20don%27t,It%27s%20not%20for%20business). We will follow this philosophy: provide basic rich text features (bold, italic, underline, bullet/numbered lists, maybe checkboxes for simple to-dos), but hide advanced options behind a toggle or context menu. The editor will **auto-save** as you type so that users never lose content[\[6\]](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=notes.notepad.checklist.calendar.todolist.notebook&hl=en_US#:~:text=Notein%2C%20the%20free%20notepad%20app,notes%20through%20the%20notes%20widget) – leveraging the Vibe SDK’s write to save to local PouchDB and sync to the cloud automatically.
-   **Minimalistic Rich Text Editor:** The rich text editor for Vibe Notes should support extensibility for later. For MVP, it allows basic formatting as described. We might use a modern React-based editor (such as Slate or Lexical) because they let us customize and embed components in the text in the future[\[7\]](https://www.contentful.com/blog/react-rich-text-editor/#:~:text=,widely%20used%20in%20web%20apps)[\[8\]](https://www.contentful.com/blog/react-rich-text-editor/#:~:text=Requires%20custom%20implementation%20for%20some,features). In the long run, this means we could embed media or interactive content in a note (for example, an iframe preview of a website or a Vibe Cloud post) similarly to how Notion supports many block types (text, images, bookmarks, videos, etc.) within a page[\[9\]](https://zapier.com/blog/best-note-taking-apps/#:~:text=Each%20new%20document%20or%20note,it%27s%20not%20forced%20on%20you). However, in the MVP these capabilities will be present behind the scenes rather than exposed in the UI. The core editing UI remains simple (mostly just text input), aligning with the principle of a _“clean and clutter-free layout… allowing users to focus on their notes without distractions.”_ Formatting buttons will appear on demand – for example, a small toolbar with text style options could pop up when a user selects some text or taps a **“Aa”** icon, similar to how Notein’s mobile app hides formatting options until the user requests them. By not having a permanent ribbon of formatting tools, the app preserves a minimalist feel during regular note-taking.
-   **Organizing Notes with Tags (Labels):** Instead of rigid folders, Vibe Notes uses a flexible tag/label system to categorize notes. Users can assign one or multiple tags to a note (e.g. _#Work_, _#Personal_, _#ProjectX_). Each tag can be color-coded for quick visual identification, inspired by how some apps provide colored categories or labels. For example, Notein allows writing notes with different colors and lets you sort or filter by color category[\[10\]](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=notes.notepad.checklist.calendar.todolist.notebook&hl=en_US#:~:text=Manage%20Notes%20by%20Color%20Good,you%20find%20your%20target%20faster). In our app, tags like “Work” or “Personal” could be given distinct colors (say, blue for Work, green for Personal), and the note list can display a small colored badge or highlight on notes to indicate their tags. A note can have multiple tags, so you might tag a note as both _ProjectX_ and _Work_. The UI will include a **tag selector** in the note editor (perhaps a “#” icon or a section below the content to add tags). Tapping it could show a dropdown of existing tags (with their colors) and an option to create a new tag (choosing a color for it). For MVP, we might seed a few default tags (Personal, Work, Others) to guide users, but they are not fixed categories – just examples. The main notes view will offer a **filter by tag** function: e.g. a dropdown or a sidebar list of tags where the user can click “Work” to filter the list to only notes tagged Work. This gives organizational flexibility similar to Gmail labels or Evernote tags. It’s simpler and more flexible than folders, which restrict a note to one folder. Tags, combined with search, should be enough for organizing a personal collection of notes in MVP. (We will **not** implement complex notebook hierarchies at this stage.)
-   **Notes List and Search:** The app’s home screen is the “All Notes” list. By default it shows all notes (since sharing is off by default, essentially all notes belong to the user). Each entry in the list shows the note’s title and maybe a snippet of the first line of the content, plus metadata like last edited timestamp. If a note has tags, small color-coded dots or labels can be shown alongside the title for quick context. Users can scroll or use a search bar at the top to quickly find notes by keyword. Searching will look at titles and note body text. Sorting options can be kept minimal: by last updated (default) or by title. (In the future, we might add manual pinning of notes to top, or archiving old notes, but MVP can start simple.) Many note apps allow toggling the view between a grid of cards vs a linear list; given our focus on desktop, a list (or two-column list) is likely more appropriate, but we could consider a grid view toggle if it comes for free. Notein, for instance, has list, grid, and “detail” modes for viewing notes[\[11\]](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=notes.notepad.checklist.calendar.todolist.notebook&hl=en_US#:~:text=,Display%20notes%20in%20list%2Fgrid%2Fdetails%20mode). For now, a single-column list is fine. The list view will have an obvious **“New Note”** button (a + icon) to create a fresh note. This view also provides access to filtering by tag (e.g. a filter menu or a sidebar with tags) as described above, so you can quickly show only notes of a certain tag. We will also include a **search field** at the top of the list, because as the number of notes grows, full-text search is essential (Notein highlights the usefulness of a search function for many notes[\[12\]](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details/Notepad_Notes_and_To_Do_List?id=com.ztnstudio.notepad&hl=en_CA#:~:text=and%20edit%20notes%2C%20write%20checklists%2C,don%E2%80%99t%20forget%20any%20important%20details)[\[13\]](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details/Notepad_Notes_and_To_Do_List?id=com.ztnstudio.notepad&hl=en_CA#:~:text=%E2%9C%94%20Location%20Reminders%20will%20alert,phone%20or%20to%20Google%20Drive)). By leveraging the local PouchDB, we can even search offline. In summary, the All Notes page serves as the central hub to browse or find your notes quickly.
-   **Attachments (Images and Files) Integration:** A standout feature of Vibe Notes (thanks to Vibe Cloud) is the ability to attach rich content from your personal cloud. Users will be able to **attach images or other files** to a note. For example, if you have a photo or screenshot in your Vibe Collections (the “drive” app), you can attach it into a note without re-uploading. We’ll add an **“Attach”** button (e.g. a paperclip or image icon) in the note editor. Clicking it opens a content picker – likely reusing Vibe React’s file picker component[\[14\]](https://github.com/Social-Systems-Lab/vibe/blob/8e07d15e4c528b89d5792bf7e0d372e29d4a6caf/docs/Vibe.md#L28-L35) – which lets the user choose an existing file from their Vibe Cloud storage or upload a new file (which would actually get stored in Vibe Cloud’s S3 storage). Once selected, the image (or file link) is inserted into the note. Images can be displayed inline (e.g. showing a smaller preview within the note content), whereas other file types might show as a linked filename or an embed if possible (for example, attaching a PDF could show a file icon and name that you can click to open). These attachments will be stored as separate file objects in the user’s cloud, and the note document will contain references (IDs or URLs) to them. Thanks to the Vibe platform’s design, picking cross-app content is a first-class capability – the platform is being built so that, say, the Feeds app can pick images from the Collections app[\[15\]](https://github.com/Social-Systems-Lab/vibe/blob/8e07d15e4c528b89d5792bf7e0d372e29d4a6caf/docs/Vibe.md#L44-L47). We’ll leverage the same interop: the note editor’s content picker will allow browsing your Collections (file drive) and selecting items to attach. This is an advantage over typical siloed note apps: for instance, Google Keep allows attaching images and drawings, but Vibe Notes could eventually allow attaching _any_ item from your cloud (images, documents, even links to other notes or posts). In MVP we’ll focus on images and maybe basic files, which covers common needs like adding photos to meeting notes or attaching a PDF reference.
-   **Privacy and Default Access:** Every note in Vibe Notes is private to the user by default. Unlike a social feed, there is no assumption that notes are shared. The UI will not prompt the user about audience or permissions when creating a note – it’s implicitly just for you (the note’s ACL in the database will be set to allow only the owner’s DID). We are intentionally **omitting any up-front ACL settings** in the note UI to keep things simple. However, because Vibe Cloud supports fine-grained sharing via ACL and certificates[\[3\]](https://github.com/Social-Systems-Lab/vibe/blob/8e07d15e4c528b89d5792bf7e0d372e29d4a6caf/docs/Vibe.md#L15-L19)[\[16\]](https://github.com/Social-Systems-Lab/vibe/blob/8e07d15e4c528b89d5792bf7e0d372e29d4a6caf/docs/Vibe.md#L58-L65), we can add sharing features later without redesigning the data model. For example, in a future update a user might choose to share a note with specific people or make it public, at which point we could expose an option to adjust the ACL or generate a shareable link. For now, the only “sharing” feature in MVP might be the ability to **export** or **share via external app** – e.g. a “Share” button that lets you copy the note’s text to clipboard or send it via email. (This is similar to how many notes apps allow you to share the content as plain text.) But collaborative editing or multi-user notes are out of scope until we introduce a proper sharing model. In essence, MVP treats notes like your personal journal or scratchpad that lives in your own cloud – **secure, private, and only online if you sign in.**
-   **Cross-Device Sync and Offline Access:** Because Vibe Notes is built on Vibe’s sync engine, it will work offline and sync seamlessly. The Next.js app can be made a Progressive Web App (PWA) so that it loads offline if previously visited. Thanks to PouchDB replication, when you create or edit notes offline in your browser, changes are saved locally and then uploaded once your connection is restored[\[1\]](https://github.com/Social-Systems-Lab/vibe/blob/8e07d15e4c528b89d5792bf7e0d372e29d4a6caf/docs/Vibe.md#L14-L19). This satisfies a key requirement for any modern note app: you can jot down ideas on the go (even with poor connectivity) and trust they will sync to the cloud and to your other devices later. Additionally, since the app is web-based and uses your Vibe account, you can access your notes from multiple devices (desktop or mobile web, and potentially a packaged mobile app in the future) – all notes are tied to your identity and stored in your personal cloud, not a single device. In practical terms, a user could start a note on their laptop and later read or edit it on their phone’s browser. The Vibe Cloud handles the heavy lifting of data sync and conflict resolution, so MVP doesn’t need to implement complex sync logic beyond calling the SDK. We will include basic visual feedback for sync state (for example, a small icon or message if offline or if a note is still syncing) to enhance transparency.

## UI Components and Pages

_Figure: Example of a modern note-taking app design with a minimalistic interface and color-coded notes. Vibe Notes will adopt a similar clean layout, focusing on a notes list and a distraction-free editor._

The Vibe Notes UI is designed to be clean and familiar. We prioritize a simple layout that feels natural on desktop (while still being responsive to mobile screens). There are two primary screens in the app: the **Notes List** view and the **Note Editor** view. On desktop, these can be presented side-by-side for convenience, whereas on mobile they would be separate screens.

### Notes List View (All Notes)

This is the main screen showing all your notes, essentially functioning like a home or dashboard for the app. It consists of a header with the app name/logo and quick actions, a search/filter area, and the list of note summaries. Key elements and UI components here:

-   **Header and Actions:** At the top, a simple header bar with the app title “Vibe Notes” (or just an icon) and a **New Note (+)** button prominently visible. If the app is integrated in the larger Vibe Cloud dashboard, this header might be minimal (since the Vibe frame may provide navigation); but as a standalone, it will have an identifiable header. The New Note button opens the editor to create a blank note. We might also have a **profile/menu icon** for user account or settings on the top-right, though for MVP the only settings might be theme toggle (dark mode) or an “About” info.
-   **Search Bar:** Just below the header, a search input allows instant filtering of notes. As the user types, the list below filters in real-time to matching titles or content (this can be implemented efficiently with local data since PouchDB can be queried, or we simply filter the in-memory list). This matches typical note app behavior (search is a must-have when you accumulate notes). If no search term is entered, all notes are shown; if text is entered, only those containing the text are listed.
-   **Tag Filter UI:** Next to or below the search box, the interface provides a way to filter by tags. On a wide screen, we could have a left sidebar listing all tags with a count of notes in each – clicking a tag filters the list. For example, a sidebar section might show: **All Notes (10)**, **Work (3)**, **Personal (5)**, **ProjectX (2)**, etc., with “All Notes” selected by default. This is similar to how Keep has its category tabs or how email clients show labels. On a narrower mobile layout, instead of a persistent sidebar, we might use a dropdown or a slide-out menu to choose a tag filter (to save screen space). The user can combine search with tag filter (e.g. filter to “Work” tag, then search within those). The UI for managing tags (adding, renaming, deleting) could be very basic in MVP – perhaps managed behind the scenes or via adding tags in the editor. We might not provide a full tag management screen initially; if a user needs to delete a tag, it disappears when no notes use it.
-   **Notes List:** The core of this page is the scrollable list of notes. Each note is displayed as a **list item** (or card) with a clickable area to open it. We will likely show the **Title** in bold and maybe the first line or a brief snippet of the content (truncated) below it, to give context. Showing a snippet is useful to remember what the note contains. On the right or bottom of each item, we can show metadata like the **last modified date** (e.g. “Edited 2 days ago” or a date stamp). If we implement pinning of notes, pinned notes could appear at the top of the list with a pin icon. We will also display any **tag indicators** here: perhaps small colored circles or text labels for each tag on that note, so the user can visually scan categories (e.g. a note tagged _Work_ might have a small blue dot). The visual design will be kept clean – probably a simple list with maybe subtle dividers between items or a card-style container with light shadow for each note. The goal is clarity and scan-ability: users should be able to glance and find the note they’re looking for either by title or by the colored tag cues.
-   **Empty State:** If the user has no notes yet, the list view will show a friendly placeholder message (like _“No notes yet. Click_ _+_ _to create your first note.”_). Similarly, if a search yields no results, we’ll display _“No notes found”_.
-   **Responsiveness:** On a desktop or large tablet, we can use the extra space to possibly show two panes: a list on the left and the content of the selected note on the right (similar to Apple Notes or Outlook email UI). In MVP, we might keep it simple and do a single-pane approach (list view switches to editor view when a note is opened). But we will design with responsiveness in mind. For example, in a wide viewport, clicking a note could open it in a panel to the right of the list (keeping the list visible for quick switching). On mobile, the navigation would be a standard master-detail: you see the list, tap a note to push the editor screen for that note (covering the whole screen), and then back to return to the list. This adaptive UI ensures the app feels at home on both desktop and mobile without separate code – just CSS and perhaps a media query or two, since Next.js/React can render conditionally based on screen size.

### Note Editor View

When the user creates a new note or opens an existing one, they are taken to the Note Editor. This is where they can read and modify the full content of the note. The design here is focused on writing and reading, so it’s even more minimal than the list. Key components of the editor page:

-   **Title Field:** At the top of the editor screen is a Title input. Typically this is a single-line text field, styled bold or larger, acting as the note’s title or summary. If the user leaves it blank, we might default to showing the first line of the note as a fallback title in the list view (like some note apps do). The title helps identify the note in the list, but it’s optional – a user could write a quick note without a title, which we’ll allow. The title field could be visually distinguished (larger font, maybe a lighter placeholder text like “Title”). It should auto-grow or wrap if the title is long, but usually titles are short.
-   **Content Editor:** Below the title is the main content area, which occupies the majority of the screen. This is a multiline text area (rendered by our rich text editor component). It should behave like a normal document editor: text wraps, Enter key for new lines/paragraphs, etc. We will likely use a rich text library to handle content state (so it’s not a plain &lt;textarea&gt; but a controlled component that supports formatting and embeds). However, the styling will by default look like a normal note – likely a simple serif or sans-serif font for the text, dark text on light background (and a dark mode invert for dark theme). When the user isn’t actively editing, we might hide the caret and just show formatted text (giving a reading mode feel). The editor will support **basic formatting shortcuts** (e.g. Ctrl/Cmd+B for bold, lists with "-" or "1." automatically starting a list, etc., depending on the chosen editor library defaults). But visibly, we won’t clutter the UI with toolbars. Instead, a **formatting toolbar** appears contextually. For instance, if the user selects some text, a small hover toolbar could fade in with options for Bold, Italic, Underline, and maybe a couple others like “H1/H2” (to turn a line into a heading) or a list button. On mobile, a common approach is a toolbar above the keyboard triggered by a “format” button – we could implement that for small screens. The idea is to follow the principle of _“focus on your notes without distractions”_, only showing controls when needed. This keeps the writing experience zen-like. We know from user feedback that _not_ having constant formatting options on screen is seen as cleaner[\[5\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/apps/comments/1hvb1s3/simple_notepad/#:~:text=I%20think%20I%20just%20don%27t,It%27s%20not%20for%20business), so we’ll aim for that balance: formatting is available but mostly hidden until invoked.
-   **Attach/Embed Area:** We discussed attachments earlier – in the UI, there will be an **Attach** icon (likely in a small top toolbar or bottom toolbar of the editor). If the user clicks the attach button, we open a file picker dialog (overlaid modal). Once an image is inserted, we show it within the content. For example, if a photo is attached, it could appear centered on its own line in the note (perhaps as a medium-size image preview). Users can click or tap the image to view it larger (maybe opening the file or a lightbox). Non-image attachments might appear as a file chip (with an icon and filename). We will ensure that these embedded elements are displayed nicely in the editor. The rich text editor we choose should support embedded nodes (for images, etc.), which we anticipate using. In MVP, attachments are primarily for viewing (no complex editing like cropping images or annotating – those would be out of scope). A simple use-case: the user can attach a photo of a whiteboard to complement written meeting notes.
-   **Tag Selector:** Somewhere in the editor UI, we need to allow adding tags to the note. A common pattern is to place tags at either the top (under the title) or bottom of the note editor. For instance, Simplenote and Bear (other note apps) show tags at the bottom of the note. We can do similar: at the bottom of the content area (or in a side panel on wide screens), there’s a small **“Tags:”** section. If the note already has tags, their names (with colored circles) are shown there. If not, it might say “Add tag”. Clicking this area opens a small menu or input where the user can type a tag name. New tags can be created on the fly by typing a new name and pressing Enter (then we’d prompt for a color selection, or auto-assign a random color from a palette which the user can change later). This tag UI should be lightweight. We want to encourage tagging because it’s the primary way to organize, but we also don’t want to annoy users who don’t care about categorizing every note. So it will be present but low-profile (maybe a small label icon).
-   **Navigation and Controls:** In the editor screen, if we’re not showing the list simultaneously, we need a way to go back to the list. On mobile, this is typically a back arrow in the header. On web/desktop, if using a single-page app style, a back arrow or a sidebar can be used. For MVP, a simple **Back** arrow in the top-left of the editor (if on a separate route) will suffice. Also in the top-right of the editor, we may place a **More** menu (⋮ or ⚙️ icon) with note-specific actions: e.g. **Delete Note**, **Share/Export**. Deleting a note would prompt confirmation and then remove it from the list (likely just marking it deleted in the database or removing it outright). We might not implement an “archive” separate from delete in MVP (to keep it simple, deletion is permanent or we move it to a trash that’s not exposed yet). The Share action, as mentioned, could copy the content to clipboard or allow the user to download their note as a text/Markdown file. Those are minor features, but adding a menu gives a place to extend functionality later (like version history or duplicate note, etc., if needed).
-   **Visual Design:** The note editor’s visual style should feel like a paper or a blank canvas for text. For readability, we’ll likely use adequate padding/margins so text isn’t glued to the screen edges. On a wide screen, we might limit the text width (for example, center the note content in the middle of the panel like a document with margins on the side) to improve readability. On mobile, it will naturally be full-width. We’ll ensure the font size is comfortable (maybe 16px for body text, larger for title). Colors: we can use a light background (white or very light grey) for the editor area in light mode, and black/dark for dark mode. The tags, being colored, will add a bit of vibrancy – but possibly we’ll use soft colors rather than very saturated ones, to keep the tone professional and not too distracting. The overall vibe (no pun intended) of the editor is _calm and focused_.

## Future Enhancements and Integration Opportunities

One of the advantages of building on Vibe Cloud is that we can gradually enhance Vibe Notes with powerful features without redesigning from scratch. While the MVP focuses on core personal note-taking, we have an eye on future improvements:

-   **Sharing and Collaboration:** In the future, we can introduce collaboration features, such as sharing a note with another user or a group. Vibe’s ACL system would allow us to give read or write access to specific DIDs or to anyone with a link, etc.[\[17\]](https://github.com/Social-Systems-Lab/vibe/blob/8e07d15e4c528b89d5792bf7e0d372e29d4a6caf/docs/Vibe.md#L60-L69). The UI might then have a “Share” button where you can invite others or toggle a note as public (creating a DocRef for global discovery[\[18\]](https://github.com/Social-Systems-Lab/vibe/blob/8e07d15e4c528b89d5792bf7e0d372e29d4a6caf/docs/Vibe.md#L18-L20)). This would blur the line between a personal note and a discussion comment. In fact, since Vibe is all about interoperability, a “note” could potentially be surfaced in other apps if shared – for example, a public note might appear as a post in a feed app via the global index. For now, we don’t implement this, but the data model and platform support it when we’re ready.
-   **Comments and Discussions:** As noted, notes and comments might converge in the Vibe ecosystem. Eventually, we might allow a note to be attached as a comment to another piece of content (e.g. you write a note while viewing a document or a post, effectively commenting on it for yourself or others). This is down the road, but our MVP design (with attachments and references) already considers that a note can link to other content. It’s conceivable that in the future, a note could have a field like “attachedTo” referencing a DocRef of another item, which turns it into a contextual comment. We’ll keep this possibility in mind so as not to design ourselves into a corner.
-   **Reminders and Calendar Integration:** Many note apps (including Notein and Google Keep) allow setting reminders on notes (time-based or location-based)[\[19\]](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details/Notepad_Notes_and_To_Do_List?id=com.ztnstudio.notepad&hl=en_CA#:~:text=HANDY%20CHECKLIST%20FUNCTION%20The%20useful,to%20the%20original%20list%20later)[\[20\]](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details/Notepad_Notes_and_To_Do_List?id=com.ztnstudio.notepad&hl=en_CA#:~:text=your%20notes,important%20notes%20so%20that%20you). In Vibe Notes, we could integrate with the user’s calendar or a reminders service to pop up notifications for certain notes (especially if we have a to-do list or checklist notes). This is not a priority for MVP, but the UI could later include a “Remind me” option in that ⋮ menu for a note.
-   **Advanced Editing Features:** As users demand more, we could add features like checklists mode (a note that is mainly a to-do list with checkable items) – Notein already has a checklist mode[\[6\]](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=notes.notepad.checklist.calendar.todolist.notebook&hl=en_US#:~:text=Notein%2C%20the%20free%20notepad%20app,notes%20through%20the%20notes%20widget). We could either detect a list and allow checkable boxes or have a toggle that switches the note to a checklist type. Other ideas include supporting markdown syntax (for power users who like that, perhaps hidden behind a setting), version history for notes, or linking notes to each other (backlinks, as in Obsidian, for power users). These are beyond MVP scope but possible since our storage is just JSON docs which could hold such structured data.
-   **Media and Embed Extensions:** In the MVP we allow images and files. Later, we might allow embedding other media like audio recordings (record directly in a note), sketches/drawings (perhaps integrating a simple canvas for handwritten notes), or even embedding a map or YouTube video via iframes. Because our editor choice is likely one that supports custom components, we can gradually introduce these. For example, a _“Insert iframe embed”_ option to paste a YouTube link and have the video playable in the note. This moves towards a Notion-like experience where notes can include a variety of content blocks[\[9\]](https://zapier.com/blog/best-note-taking-apps/#:~:text=Each%20new%20document%20or%20note,it%27s%20not%20forced%20on%20you). We would introduce these carefully to not clutter the UI; perhaps an “Insert” menu with options for different block types, which we keep minimal by default.
-   **Integration with Other Vibe Apps:** As Vibe Cloud will have apps like Collections (file storage), Feeds (social posts), and more, we can make Vibe Notes interplay with them. We already handle attaching files from Collections. In the future, a note could be published to Feeds (e.g., _“Share to feed”_ turns your note into a social post visible to an audience). Or from the dashboard, a user searching their stuff could find public notes from others if shared (via global DocRefs). Another example: when writing a post in Vibe Feeds, you might attach a note or convert a note into a long-form post. The platform’s interoperability promise is that your data isn’t siloed[\[21\]](https://github.com/Social-Systems-Lab/vibe/blob/8e07d15e4c528b89d5792bf7e0d372e29d4a6caf/docs/Vibe.md#L60-L64), so we envision Vibe Notes eventually as not just a standalone app but as a piece of the larger ecosystem (for now, we concentrate on making it a great standalone notes app first).
-   **Mobile App and PWA:** While the initial app is web-based, we intend to ensure it works well on mobile browsers and maybe package it as a PWA or hybrid app for convenience. Features like offline support, fast loading, and a responsive UI will make it feel native. Down the road, if needed, we could create a native wrapper (using React Native or Capacitor) for app store distribution, but given the web-first approach of Vibe (open and PWA-friendly)[\[22\]](https://github.com/Social-Systems-Lab/vibe/blob/8e07d15e4c528b89d5792bf7e0d372e29d4a6caf/docs/Vibe.md#L54-L57), the web app itself might suffice for most users.

In summary, **Vibe Notes MVP** will deliver a polished, minimal note-taking experience focusing on personal productivity: _quick note creation, easy editing, tagging, and attaching content_, all while keeping the interface **simple and intuitive**. The design follows the principle of not overwhelming the user with options initially – “minimalistic design that allows users to focus on their notes without distractions” – but with the robust Vibe Cloud backend, it sets the stage for richer features in the future. By starting simple (like the best single-user notes apps) and leveraging the Vibe ecosystem quietly in the background, Vibe Notes can grow into a powerful, interoperable note system as Vibe Cloud evolves, all without compromising on usability in its MVP form.
