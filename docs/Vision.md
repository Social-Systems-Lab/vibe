Mission
Vibe returns ownership of identity, data, and social connections to individuals. We’re building a user-controlled platform where your digital life is portable across apps, with privacy and consent at the core. The aim is to make Big Tech platforms optional by offering a practical, joyful alternative.

Why now

-   Activists and grassroots movements need resilience, censorship resistance, and autonomy.
-   People want fewer gatekeepers and more portability—identity, content, and audiences shouldn’t be trapped.
-   Developers are reinventing the same auth/storage/privacy problems in every app.

Core principles

-   Self-sovereignty: Users hold the keys; identity, data, and connections belong to them.
-   Consent and transparency: Apps get only the access users grant, visible and revocable.
-   Interoperability by design: Shared protocols and schemas instead of silos.
-   Local-first and verifiable: Prefer client-side caching; verify sources and permissions cryptographically.
-   Open and self-hostable: Managed hosting for convenience, but the stack can be self-hosted.
-   Pragmatism: Ship useful building blocks first, expand scope iteratively.

What Vibe is

-   Personal Cloud: A user-owned service for identity, data, files, and permissions (self-hosted or managed).
-   SDKs and components: Simple building blocks for auth, storage, real-time sync, and cross-app data sharing.
-   Global discovery: Public data indexed as DocRefs for fast feeds/search while preserving user ownership at the source.

What Vibe enables
For people

-   Own your identity, content, and connections.
-   Move freely across apps—your posts, files, ratings, and followers come with you.
-   Clear, revocable permissions; privacy by default.
    For communities and movements
-   Autonomy and resilience: no single corporate gatekeeper.
-   Self-governing patterns supported via certificates and group rules.
-   Easier organizing and discovery across tools.
    For developers
-   Zero-backend path: ship apps with auth/storage/real-time without running servers.
-   Interop with user-approved data across apps.
-   Strong defaults for security, privacy, and compliance.

Near-term goals

-   Ship Cloud Alpha (managed and self-host), with self-host guides.
-   Solidify consent, ACLs, and certificate issuance/revocation.
-   Deliver global DocRefs and client expansion for public discovery/feeds.
-   Polish SDK/React DX and tutorials; productionize demo apps (feeds, collections).
-   Minimal ActivityPub bridge for profiles/posts/follows.

Medium-term vision

-   Social primitives: portable profiles, follows, posts, messaging with E2E patterns.
-   App suite that showcases interop: drive, contacts, calendar, feeds, messaging.
-   Data format registry: emergent schemas (zod-based) to improve cross-app compatibility.
-   Recommendations you control: “magnetic feeds” operating on local caches and trusted aggregators.
-   Backup/sync and multi-device UX with strong key management and recovery.

Longer-term vision (“Vibe Phone” and beyond)

-   An opinionated device or distribution bundling Vibe Cloud, apps, and connectivity—“a vehicle for freedom.”
-   Accessible defaults: free/low-cost options, community-run hosting, and discovery.
-   Bridges to broader ecosystems (ActivityPub/Fediverse, other PDS models) so users can traverse networks without losing identity or audience.

Positioning

-   Compared to Mastodon/ActivityPub or Bluesky/PDS, Vibe generalizes beyond social: it’s a personal cloud and SDK for any app category, with consented data sharing and verifiable access. We aim to interoperate with social protocols while preserving our broader scope (identity, files, credentials, general collections).

Ethos
Gentle, friendly, and liberating. A declaration of independence from Big Tech: we build step-by-step, replacing dependencies with user-owned alternatives—until digital freedom is normal.

Call to collaborate
We’re seeking aligned developers, pilot communities (activists, grassroots orgs, creators), and partners to test early features, co-design real use cases, and shape sustainable hosting and governance models.
