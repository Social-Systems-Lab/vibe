   - Add developer tooling for debugging and monitoring

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Implement comprehensive test suites for all components
   - Add integration testing across the platform
   - Create testing utilities for developers building on Vibe

3. **Local Development**
   - Enhance the local development experience with better tooling
   - Provide development containers for consistent environments
   - Create streamlined onboarding for new developers

## Data Management

1. **Schema Evolution**
   - Implement versioned schemas for backward compatibility
   - Add migration tools for evolving data structures
   - Create schema validation and enforcement mechanisms

2. **Query Capabilities**
   - Enhance query capabilities with more advanced filtering and sorting
   - Add support for complex data aggregations
   - Implement efficient pagination for large result sets

3. **Real-time Sync**
   - Optimize real-time synchronization mechanisms
   - Add conflict resolution strategies
   - Implement offline-first capabilities with robust sync

## Security and Privacy

1. **Fine-grained Permissions**
   - Implement the planned "Ask" mode for more granular consent
   - Add field-level permissions for documents
   - Create better visualization of permission chains

2. **Audit and Compliance**
   - Enhance audit logging for all sensitive operations
   - Add compliance reporting for data access
   - Implement data retention and deletion policies

3. **Encryption**
   - Add end-to-end encryption for sensitive data
   - Implement key rotation mechanisms
   - Create secure key management workflows

## Deployment and Operations

1. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Implement comprehensive monitoring for all services
   - Add distributed tracing for request flows
   - Create dashboards for system health and performance

2. **Self-hosting Improvements**
